NAME
    Badger::Changes - Summary of changes in the Badger toolkit

CHANGES
  Version 0.04 (of which 0.03_01 is a developer pre-release)

    Changed Badger::Factory to pass $name as an argument to various methods.

    Moved a whole bunch of stuff out of Badger::Class into
    "Badger::Class::*" modules.

    Added Badger::Class::Config for simple configuration.

    Added hash() method to Badger::Methods and hash_methods hook to
    Badger::Class.

    Added trace() hook and related paraphernalia to Badger::Exception

    Added Codec() exportable subroutine to Badger::Codecs.

    Added Badger::Codec::URL. It's similar to Badger::Codec::URI, but
    slightly different. See the TT uri/url filters for the reason.

  Version 0.03
    Added delegate loaders to Badger. This provides some semantic sugar for
    loading a bunch of different "Badger::*" modules in one go.

        use Badger
            Filesystem  => 'FS $Bin',
            Codecs      => 'storable base64',
            Debug       => {
                modules => 'My::Module',
            };

    Added different() to Badger::Test::Manager.

    Added textlike() to Badger::Utils

    Added the overload as_text and is_true import hooks and related method
    to Badger::Class. These delegate to the "overload" module.

    Added the print method to Badger::Filesystem::File.

    Added support for dynamic root directories to
    Badger::Filesystem::Virtual.

    Added the defaults and aliases hooks to Badger::Class, implemented by
    Badger::Class::Defaults and Badger::Class::Aliases, respectively. There
    are still experimental.

    Fixed up some stat handling in Badger::Filesystem to help with
    subclassing in Badger::Filesystem::Virtual

    Mr T pities the fool that attempts to builds a production system based
    on Badger version 0.03 without first evaluating it carefully and reading
    the documentation.

  Version 0.02
    Badger::Class got the vars method and hook for declaring and defining
    variables.

    Badger::Utils gained the ability to load and export functions from
    Scalar::Util, List::Util, List::MoreUtils, Hash::Util and Digest::MD5.

    Various documentation updates.

    Mr T admires the tenacity of anyone attempting to build a production
    system based on Badger v0.02 and hopes they have a thorough test suite.

  Version 0.01
    This was the first release version.

    Mr T pities the fool who builds a production system based on Badger
    v0.01.
