Badger::Changes - Summary of changes in the Badger toolkit

=head1 CHANGES

=head2 Version 0.05

Refactored L<Badger::Factory>.

Added support to L<Badger::Exporter> for the C<=> pseudo-sigil which can be
used to create constants on the fly.

    package Badger::Example;
    use Badger::Class
        exports => {
            tags => {
                math => {
                    e   => '=2.718',
                    pi  => '=3.142',
                    phi => '=1.618',
                },
            }
        };
    
    package main;
    use Badger::Example ':math';
    
    print e;            # 2.718
    print pi;           # 3.142
    print phi;          # 1.618

=head2 Version 0.04

Added the L<throw_msg()|Badger::Base/throw_msg()> method to L<Badger::Base>.

Added L<init_method|Badger::Class/init_method> hook to L<Badger::Class> and 
L<initialiaser()|Badger::Class/initialiaser()> to L<Badger::Class::Methods>.

Changed L<Badger::Exception> L<match_type()|Badger::Exception/match_type()>
method to accept a list or hash reference, or a string of whitespace delimited 
exception types.

Changed L<Badger::Factory> to pass C<$name> as an argument to various methods.
Also passes arguments to load() (required for Template::TT2::Plugins)
Also modified L<item()|Badger::Factory/item()> to accept a non-textlike 
type argument which bypasses the module lookup.

Moved a whole bunch of stuff out of L<Badger::Class> into C<Badger::Class::*>
modules.

Added L<Badger::Class::Config> for simple configuration.

Added L<hash()|Badger::Methods/hash()> method to L<Badger::Methods> and 
L<hash_methods|Badger::Class|hash_methods> hook to L<Badger::Class>.

Added L<trace()|Badger::Exception/trace> hook and related paraphernalia to
L<Badger::Exception>. Added the C<-t> / C<--trace> command line options to
L<Badger::Test> to enable it when running tests.  Also added C<-h> / C<--help>
options.

Added L<Codec()|Badger::Codecs/Codec()> exportable subroutine to 
L<Badger::Codecs>.

Added L<Badger::Codec::URL>.  It's similar to L<Badger::Codec::URI>,
but slightly different.  See the TT uri/url filters for the reason.

Changed the L<prototype()|Badger::Prototype/prototype()> method in
L<Badger::Prototype> to accept a single C<undef> value to clear any current
prototype. Also added the L<has_prototype()|Badger::Prototype/has_prototype()>
method.

=head2 Version 0.03

Added delegate loaders to L<Badger>.  This provides some semantic sugar
for loading a bunch of different C<Badger::*> modules in one go.

    use Badger
        Filesystem  => 'FS $Bin',
        Codecs      => 'storable base64',
        Debug       => {
            modules => 'My::Module',
        };

Added L<different()|Badger::Test::Manager/different()> to 
L<Badger::Test::Manager>.

Added L<textlike()|Badger::Utils/textlike()> to L<Badger::Utils>

Added the L<overload|Badger::Class/overload>
L<as_text|Badger::Class/as_text> and 
L<is_true|Badger::Class/is_true> import hooks and related method to
L<Badger::Class>.  These delegate to the C<overload> module.

Added the L<print|Badger::Filesystem::File/print()> method to 
L<Badger::Filesystem::File>.

Added support for 
L<dynamic root directories|Badger::Filesystem::Virtual/"virtual root directories">
to L<Badger::Filesystem::Virtual>.

Added the L<defaults|Badger::Class/defaults> and L<aliases|Badger::Class/aliases>
hooks to L<Badger::Class>, implemented by L<Badger::Class::Defaults> and 
L<Badger::Class::Aliases>, respectively.  There are still experimental.

Fixed up some stat handling in L<Badger::Filesystem> to help with subclassing
in L<Badger::Filesystem::Virtual>

Mr T pities the fool that attempts to builds a production system based on
Badger version 0.03 without first evaluating it carefully and reading the
documentation.

=head2 Version 0.02

L<Badger::Class> got the L<vars|Badger::Class/vars()> method and hook
for declaring and defining variables.

L<Badger::Utils> gained the ability to load and export functions from 
L<Scalar::Util>, L<List::Util>, L<List::MoreUtils>, L<Hash::Util> and
L<Digest::MD5>.

Various documentation updates.

Mr T admires the tenacity of anyone attempting to build a production system
based on Badger v0.02 and hopes they have a thorough test suite.

=head2 Version 0.01

This was the first release version. 

Mr T pities the fool who builds a production system based on Badger v0.01.
