This file is large in size.  By "large", we mean it is larger than
420 bytes, which just happens to be an arbitrary size that we test 
for in the t/filesystem/visitor.t test script.  In order to make it
longer than 420 bytes, I now have to randomly typed whatever comes
into my head until I've got... hmm let's see, 420 / 70 = 6 so I 
reckon I need to type a few more words until this line is complete
and then I think I'll be done.
