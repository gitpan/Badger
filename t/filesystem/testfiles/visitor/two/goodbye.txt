Marty: I'm not...
Nigel: The sustain... listen to it...
Marty: I'm not hearing anything.
Nigel: You would, though, if it were playing, because it really... it's

Marty: Well I mean so you don't....
Nigel: Aaaaaaaaaaa...  You could go and have a bite
       an'...aaaaaaa... you'd still be hearin' that one.
