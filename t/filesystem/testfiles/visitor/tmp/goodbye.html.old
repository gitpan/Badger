      Nigel: Just listen for a minute...
      Marty: I'm not...
      Nigel: The sustain... listen to it...
      Marty: I'm not hearing anything.
      Nigel: You would, though, if it were playing, because it really... it's
             famous for its sustain... I mean, you could, just hold it...
      Marty: Well I mean so you don't....
      Nigel: Aaaaaaaaaaa...  You could go and have a bite
             an'...aaaaaaa... you'd still be hearin' that one.
